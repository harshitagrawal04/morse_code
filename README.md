Morse Code Translator

Overview

This project is a simple Morse Code Translator that allows users to convert text into Morse code and vice versa. It provides a way to encode and decode messages with the use of Morse code, which is a communication system using dots, dashes, and spaces. The application supports letters, numbers, and common symbols.

Why the Project is Useful

Morse code is still used in various fields such as aviation, amateur radio, and emergency communication. This project provides users with an easy way to learn Morse code or encode and decode messages in this format. It can be useful for educational purposes, hobbyists, or anyone interested in encryption and communication methods.

What Users Can Do with the Project

Encode: Convert regular text into Morse code.
Decode: Convert Morse code back into readable text.
Validation: Ensure that the message contains valid characters before encoding or decoding.
Users can input a message in either plain text or Morse code, and the application will handle the conversion accordingly.

How to Get Started

Input a message that you want to encode or decode.
Choose whether to encrypt (encode) or decrypt (decode) the message.
The application will validate your input and either output the corresponding Morse code or the decoded message.
Note: In case the input is already in Morse code, the program will prompt you to choose whether to re-encode or decode the message.
